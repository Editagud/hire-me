# Interested in working for shield?

Give us a chance to see your beautiful code! 🤩 

How to get started:
- Fork this repository
- Use [Nx](https://nx.dev/) to generate a small application with [Angular](https://angular.io/) + [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- Setup [Ant Design for Angular](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en)
- Create a *sign up application* that utilize the components from the UI framework
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

The application should be able to do 3 things:
1. Enable users to sign up via a form (`firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`)
3. Only allow users to sign up once (based on `email`)
4. Show a list of users who signed up

There are no other requirements than that — take a look at the [Wireframes](#wireframes) for inspiration.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to jobs@shieldapp.ai ☺️

## FAQ
- **Should I use a real database like Postgres to store the information or can I simply store it in a variable?**
    - It perfectly fine if you use a variable 👌 Please add a `docker-compose.yml` file in case you decide to use a database like Postgres
- **How long should it take me to complete the assignment?**
    - It should take you less than 8 hours but it depends on your Typescript wizard magic skills 🪄
- **What about tests?**
    - Unit [jest](https://jestjs.io/), E2E using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) are heavily used here at @shieldapp so it won't hurt if you include them 😎
