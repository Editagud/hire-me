# Interested in working for shield?

Give us a chance to see your beautiful code! ü§© 

How to get started:
- Fork this repository
- Use [Nx](https://nx.dev/) to generate a small application with [Angular](https://angular.io/) + [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- Setup [Ant Design for Angular](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en)
- Create a *sign up application* that utilize the components from the UI framework
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

The application should be able to do 3 things:
1. Enable users to sign up via a form (`firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`)
2. Only allow users to sign up once (based on `email`)
3. Show a list users who signed up

There are no other requirements than that ‚Äî take a look at the [Wireframes](#wireframes) for inspiration.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to jobs@shieldapp.ai ‚ò∫Ô∏è
